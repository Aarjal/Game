# 🚦 City Control: Rush Hour

A fast-paced, arcade-style city management game played entirely through a control panel interface.

Instead of controlling a character in the world, you manage the city through menus, alerts, and buttons. Handle emergencies quickly, prevent disasters, and score as high as possible before time runs out.

Built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no libraries required.

## 🎮 Gameplay

You work as a city operations controller during rush hour.

Events appear rapidly on your dashboard:

• Ambulances need routes  
• Fires break out  
• Traffic jams form  
• Police chases occur  
• Buses require rerouting  

Click **Fix** before time runs out.

### Rules
- Each correct action → +10 points
- Miss an event → lose 1 life
- 3 lives total
- 60 seconds per round
- Highest score wins

Fast reflexes = better score.

## 🧠 Design Concept

This game follows three core constraints:

### Camera: Interface Only
No world view. Everything happens through UI panels and alerts.

### Gameplay: Arcade
Short rounds, quick decisions, increasing pressure.

### Setting: Urban
All mechanics are based on city systems like traffic and emergency services.

Inspired by the feel of management and reflex games where speed matters more than exploration.
